                    <p>Holi is one of the most popular and significant festivals in India, also known as the "Festival of Colors" or the "Festival of Love." It marks the arrival of spring and the end of winter, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.</p>
                    <p>The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm across India and has now spread to many parts of the world. People come together to throw colored powders (gulal) and water at each other, dance, sing, and feast on special delicacies.</p>

                    <p>The festival has several legends associated with it. The most popular one is the story of Holika and Prahlad. According to Hindu mythology, King Hiranyakashipu had a son named Prahlad who was a devotee of Lord Vishnu. The king, who considered himself a god, was angered by his son's devotion to Vishnu.</p>
                    <p>Hiranyakashipu's sister, Holika, had a special cloak that protected her from fire. The king asked her to sit in a pyre with Prahlad, expecting his son to burn while Holika remained safe. However, the cloak flew from Holika and covered Prahlad, protecting him while Holika burned. This event is celebrated as Holika Dahan, which takes place the night before Holi.</p>
                    <p>Another legend associates Holi with Lord Krishna, who playfully applied color on his beloved Radha and other gopis (milkmaids). This playful tradition continues today as part of Holi celebrations.</p>
