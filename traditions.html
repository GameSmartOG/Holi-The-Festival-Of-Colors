                        <p>In the small town of Barsana near Mathura, a unique tradition called "Lathmar Holi" is celebrated. According to legend, Lord Krishna visited his beloved Radha's village, Barsana, and playfully teased her and her friends. In response, the women of Barsana chased him away with sticks (lathis).</p>
                        <p>Today, men from Krishna's village, Nandgaon, visit Barsana, where women playfully beat them with sticks while the men use shields to protect themselves. The men also sing provocative songs to invite the attention of women. This playful ritual attracts thousands of tourists each year.</p>

                        <p>The evening before the main day of Holi, people gather around a bonfire called Holika Dahan. This ritual symbolizes the victory of good over evil, based on the legend of Holika and Prahlad.</p>
                        <p>People perform prayers, sing songs, and circle the bonfire. Some communities also roast grains, popcorn, and coconut in the bonfire, which are then distributed as prasad (offerings). The ashes from the bonfire are considered sacred, and some people apply them on their bodies.</p>

                        <p>The main ritual of Holi is playing with colors. Traditionally, these colors were made from natural sources like flowers, herbs, and spices. Today, both natural and synthetic colors are used.</p>
                        <p>The application of colors has a special significance. People first apply a tilak (mark) of color on the forehead as a sign of respect before smearing colors on the face and body. It's also customary to seek blessings from elders by applying colors to their feet.</p>
